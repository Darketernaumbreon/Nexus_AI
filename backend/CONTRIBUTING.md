# Contributing to NExus-AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NExus-AI!

## Branching Policy

- **Main Branch (`main`)**: This branch contains the stable, production-ready code. Direct commits to `main` are restricted.
- **Development Branch (`development`)**: This is the primary branch for integration. All feature branches should target `development`.
- **Feature Branches**: Contributors **must** create a separate branch for each piece of work (feature, bugfix, etc.).

### naming Convention
- `feature/your-feature-name`
- `fix/your-bug-fix`
- `docs/documentation-update`

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository (if you don't have write access).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Create a new branch from `development`: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature development`.
4. Make your changes and commit them.
5. Push your branch to the remote.
6. Submit a Pull Request targeting the `development` branch.
